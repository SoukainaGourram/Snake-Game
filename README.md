# Snake-Game
A simple Snake game implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

## Overview

This Snake game is a classic implementation where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer. The goal is to achieve the highest score without colliding with walls or the snake's own body.

## Features

- **Responsive Controls:** Use arrow keys to navigate the snake.
- **Scoring:** Each food item eaten increases the player's score.
- **Growing Snake:** The snake grows longer as it consumes food.
- **Game Over:** Colliding with walls or the snake's body ends the game.
- **Randomized Food:** Food items appear at random locations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Controls

## Gameplay

The snake grows longer after consuming each food item.
Avoid collisions with walls and the snake's body to prevent game over.
